# The Story Behind FDJASVS X

**PIG 64(Where FDJASVS X Really Originated)**

As You may or may not know, I Am A Huge Fan Of The Hit Roblox experience Called "Piggy".

Well, an hour before the release of "PIG 64" - A Piggy Game Inspired By Super Mario 64. I decided to tell ChatGPT to write Me a Python app that looked like this:

## How It All Started...
So, I was trolling one of my friends with a "FDJASVS X" - A Fake Executor written in Python By ChatGPT and It Looked like This:

At that time, I didn't really think much of It as It was just a prank. But because I had joy of making It, I added more _"features"_.

A few days later though, FDJASVS X Premium Was Born. With new _"features"_ like:

![Uncopylocking](https://github.com/FDJASVS-X/.github/blob/main/Images/b.png)

It's kinda obvious the "features" are fake lol, yet he still fell for it
